## VisionX : OverView
VisionX is all in one computer vision project that includes diverse applications such as : Text detecting, color detecting, object detection
where also by using only hand gestures we can demonstrate AI virtual mouse, AI virtual painter and gesture volume control.
if you scroll down you find the demonstration of these applications:

### 4. AI Virtual Mouse :
- **goal**: To control the mouse pointer using an index finger and click defined by threshold between the index and the middle fingers.
- **Results**:

### 5. Gesture Volume Control :
- **goal**: To control the volume of media players using hand gestures.
- **Results**:

### 6. AI Virtual Painter :
- **goal**: To use hand gestures for drawing in digital canvas with multiple colors you can choose and select, with the ability of earasing with rubber.
- **Results**:
